This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Music Box

Web application to search and listen to music from Soundcloud

Revisited project from music box, version without Redux, state managed by props drilling, proper component hierarchy and new custom hooks usage. <br /> 
This application uses the Soundcloud API to retrieve songs and allows the user to play them.<br />
My goal with this project was to create a web application using React + Redux to control a global state and manage streamable media content reproduction<br />
The application implements a custom web player, that can be operated from each individual song or with the global web controls <br />
